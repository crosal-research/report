\section{Our COPOM Call}
\label{sec:orgc2ab3ef}
\begin{compactitem}[$\diamond$]
\item \textbf{Our Call}: We believe the Central Bank (CB) shall cut the Selic by
125bps this coming Wednesday. As a matter of fact, we understand it
could dare further, however, based upon the conservatism shown till
the moment, we feel more comfortable in expecting a more contrived
move this time around.

In addition, it is not unlikely the CB hints that it may pursue a
single digit rate already in 1H2017. In this respect, any move shall
depend on the CB's risk assessment with regards to short-term risks,
in particular, to the outcome of social security reform, which
revolves around subjective judgments as well as information that
only those in Brasilia may hold.

\item \textbf{The Size of the Budget}. The incoming data continued to underscore
that the economy is stuck in a depression and that signs of recovery
are mixed, at best. As matter of example, the Central bank's GDP
tracker shrunk 0.26\%momsa in January, while industrial production
tanked 0.7\%mom in February. To put it mildly, this is rather
disappointing for an economy with an output gap estimated at about
3-4\% below potential.

On the inflation front, CPI inflation is already on target, having
reached 4.57\% in March. Moreover, the average month-on-month
annualized rate in the 1Q2017 has reached a dismal 3.8\%, while the
2018E expected inflation is at 4.5\%. Hence, if one sums all that up
with the state of the economy, it is not difficult to see that any
type of taylor rule should advocate a rate at about 200bps below
neutral, currently standing at 9.6\% by market metrics (real rate of
5.1\% plus inflation target).

Therefore, when we take the aforementioned figures into
consideration, along with the fact that the fiscal policy is on the
contraction mode and subsidized credit has collapsed, we understand
there is still a huge budget of cuts ahead of us, of about 450bps.

\item \textbf{Risks}. As usual, risks abound, but as far as the intervening
period between this week's meeting and the one in May is concerned,
we reckon two of them call for special attention. On the local
front, a negative outcome for social security reform may lead to a
meaningful market dislocation, particularly in face of the fact that
local assets look a bit pricey relative to the uncertainties
concerning the reform.

On the global camp, besides the usual worries concerning
international financial conditions, the first round of French
Presidential election scheduled to April 23 can potentially send
waves of shocks across the globe. However, from our vantage point,
their possible impact seem less worrying relative to those on the
local front.

\item \textbf{Net/Net}: Be all that as it may, while the realization of the
aforementioned negative outcomes may indeed shorten the length of
the easing cycle, we understand that a 125bps cut in this
Wednesday's meeting wouldn't lead the Central Bank into any radical
u-turn, should any of these events occur. In the meantime, on the
margin, the move could entail a more expedient recovery of the
economy, which has already taken far too long, with many negative
feedback loops, in particular, over fiscal policy outlook.
